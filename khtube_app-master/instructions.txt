For creating https certificate i.e. ssl

sudo openssl req -x509 nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-self-signed.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-self-signed.crt


# Make an elastic ip address.
# Open port 80 and 443 in security groups by enabling http and https
# write simple flaskapp server with port 80 opened. No need to write there 443.
# connect your aws ip with the domain name in A and Cname section.
# You can do this by making subdomain and then adding it.
# For the ssl certificate make an account on cloudflare and then connect your domain name with cloudflare. 


# For installing chrome in ec2 instance 

wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb

# check installation
google-chrome-stable --version

# install selenium
pip3 install selenium --user


# For checking the runing processes with the name of gunicorn, write this command.
pgrep gunicorn
# For killing the process run
kill <process id>

All the timers should be same.
For now perfect one is 900s
Also try 500s on both.

#For killing a process outside the function we used exec keyword in our terminal based commands and also defined global variable. e.g below:
global ppid
global scr_process
proc = subprocess.Popen(f'exec python {cwd}/Youtube_flask/yt_original.py --user_kw="{user_kw}"', shell=True, stdin=None, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
# proc = subprocess.Popen(f'exec python {cwd}/yt_original.py --user_kw="{user_kw}"', shell=True, stdin=None, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
ppid = proc.pid
scr_process = proc
